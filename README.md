Panacea Mobile Public Push Application Demo
=================

This is a demo of how to handle push notifications from the Panacea app and service.

In order to use this software, download/clone it on a server which supports PHP and MySQL.

You will need to update app/Config/database.php to reflect your database settings. You will also need to import sql/app-handler.sql into the database in order for this to work.

Once you have installed it - you can then create your applications with API keys you have registered here http://labs.panaceamobile.com/push-public-sender/

To use your newly installed demo as the notification URL for your API key, make sure you point the notification URL to http://yourserver.com/demo-app-path/process-notifications

Good luck! Contact support@panaceamobile.com if you need assistance.
